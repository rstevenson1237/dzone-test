   ```bash
   chmod +x project_manager.sh
   ```

2. Initialize the project:
   ```bash
   ./project_manager.sh init
   ```

3. Open Godot and load the project

4. Begin Phase 1 development

5. Commit regularly:
   ```bash
   ./project_manager.sh commit "Your commit message"
   ```

This plan provides a structured approach to recreating Destruction Zone while leveraging modern game development practices and tools. The modular design allows for iterative development and testing, ensuring each phase builds solidly on the previous work.
